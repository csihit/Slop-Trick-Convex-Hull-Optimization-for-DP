# Slop-Trick-Convex-Hull-Optimization-for-DP
Optimize DP with geometry! Picture DP states as graph points and costs as a jagged mountain. Instead of O(n) brute force, use the Slope Trick—a clever method that cuts through the noise with binary search, reducing time to O(log n). Curious how? Dive into today’s code snippet to see it in action!
